# Hourglass

## The problem

This repo was created as a portfolio project. My main goal was to get to know arduino, C++ and project building. I used a video as reference to get to know some hourglass properties, but did not see or use any code by other coders.

## Repo structure

This repo is structured as follows

* Board.py contains the necessary code for 1 led matrix
* Hourglass.py contains the code for combining 2 boards and connecting the sand between boards
* main.py contains the code for a test run

## main.py

This file will create a led matrix of 8 x 8 leds and print a test run to the console

## Future of this project

This project will serve as a backbone for a rework to the arduino platform, in C++. I still have to learn C++ however
